ClipNinja is a minimalistic macOS tool for effective copy & paste. How minimalistic? It only has two features - history and pasting! That minimalistic. You can also pin what's important to keep it around longer. So, three, but that's it!

Features are scarce, on purpose. But it's private, with no clouds and no companion apps. No analytics, no data collection, none of that corporate bullshit. What you copy and paste is yours; it stays yours and forever will.

ClipNinja does not analyze your behavior to keep you engaged. It doesn't sway your attention. It's there to help, not to usurp. Want to paste something from the history? CMD+SHIFT+V, find it, paste it, and do your thing. The goal is to spend the least possible amount of time here.
