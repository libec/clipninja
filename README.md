ClipNinja is a minimalistic copy & paste tool for macOS. How minimalistic? It only has two features - history and pasting! That minimalistic. You can also pin stuff. So, three, but that's it!

It's privateâ€”no clouds, analytics, data collection, none of that corporate bullshit. What you copy is yours; it stays and forever will.

Zero behavior analysis to keep you engaged. Want to paste something? CMD+SHIFT+V, paste it, disengage and focus on your thing. It's here to help, not to usurp.
