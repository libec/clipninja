ClipNinja is a minimalistic copy & paste tool for macOS. How minimalistic? It has two features - history and pasting! That minimalistic. You can also pin stuff. So, three, but that's it!

It's private. No clouds, analytics, data collection, or behavior analysis to keep you engagedâ€”none of that corporate bullshit. 

What you copy is yours; it stays and forever will.
